# Predicting Credit Card Default with Neural Networks

## By: Cyrus Navasca

This project utilizes PyTorch to construct a neural network in order to predict credit card default among clients. Statistical techniques such as L2 regularization and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address overfitting and improve model performance. The final neural network achieved a prediction accuracy of 78% and performed well according to other evaluation metrics such as ROC-AUC and precision/recall.
